About:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mind Rush is an obstacle avoidance game in the style of classic
"boulder dodge" style games.

What makes Mind Rush unique is that it supports bio-feedback control in the 
form of eye-movement and concentration.

I created the original program as part of my Real World Measurements course
as a Freshman at Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering. After the course 
was over, I teamed up with Patrick Varin to make an improved version that 
uses an Arduino and an EMG that can map your eye movement directly onto a
computer screen.

Basic Dependencies (no biofeedback devices):
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Python 2.6 (other versions untested but should work)
- pygame

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Biofeedback Device Hardware Requirements/Dependencies
(The new version of MindRush supports only eye control, but mind control
will be easy to add in the future)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- pyserial
- An Arduino (we used the Arduino UNO) with a USB cable connected to a 
  battery-powered laptop
- The circuit detailed in ./eyeCircuit.png. It can be built on a breadboard.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The new version of MindRush is extremely simple to set up in comparison
to the version in ./old. It currently only supports eye control, but
EEG control via a Mattel Mindflex headset is planned in the near future.

To run it without any biofeedback devices, simply run "python mindrush.py"

  better understand the risks associated with using non-medically approved
  hardware (http://openeeg.sourceforge.net/doc/WARNING.html).

1. Build the circuit depicted in ./eyeCircuit.png
2. Connect the left_eye input to an electrode on your left temple.
3. Connect the right_eye input to an electrode on your right temple. 
4. Connect the forehead input to an electrode on your forehead.
5. Connect the Arduino A0 pin to the output in the diagram.
6. Connect the Arduino's 5V power rail to the circuit. This requires basic
   circuitry experience because the circuit requires 2.5V power at several
   locations.
7. After checking the circuit thoroughly, connect the Arduino to a *battery*
   powered laptop. Connecting your head to a computer powered by a wall outlet
   could, in the unlikely event of a system failure or power surge, result
   in brain damage or death. Do NOT do this.
8. Modify the commented section of ./mindrush.py as necessary.

5/10/11:
- Mind Rush fully supports eye movement-driven operation
- Mindflex EEG devices are supported but not used
- Basic gameplay and scoring is implemented

5/7/11:
- Patrick Varin and Julian Ceipek are on their way to making an extensible architecture
- On the hardware side, we are switching to using an Arduino for data acquisition
- We intend to use a more powerful EMG circuit that Patrick Varin helped design
