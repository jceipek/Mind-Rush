About:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mind Rush is an obstacle avoidance game in the style of classic "boulder dodge" style games.

What makes Mind Rush unique is that it supports bio-feedback control in the form of eye-movement and concentration.

I created it as part of my Real World Measurements course as a Freshman at Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering.

Basic Dependencies:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Python 2.6 (other versions untested)
- pygame

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
By default, Mind Rush will run as a basic, single-threaded python program.

To run it, cd into ./old and run "python mindRush.py".

Since it was created as a proof-of-concept HCI experiment within a very short timeframe, its bio-feedback features are difficult to set up and currently require specialized hardware and software. Please read old/Install.pdf to get started with these features.

Source Code and Future:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The code in ./old is poorly designed, is difficult to extend, and has several bugs. Now that the project is over, I am rewriting Mind Rush from scratch with an extensible custom game engine for python, based on my work for the Complete Galactic Dominion RTS project. If I have time, I will try to reduce the hardware and software requirements for the bio-feedback parts of the project.
